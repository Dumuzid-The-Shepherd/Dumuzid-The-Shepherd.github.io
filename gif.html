    <p>Ethan rolls over, grabs his dream journal and starts writing. </p>
    <p>"I am lying on the concrete pavement, fighting against something invisible, it's not there, it never was. Blood drips from my nose onto the curb, it simmers and creates steam when it makes contact. The sun is directly overhead, under its gaze I feel futile. I pick myself up and I keep on walking. My feet stick to the floor and my skin turns to melted wax, it drips down my torso and turns to mist on impact with the ground. I collapse and break my fall with my hands, it's OVER. I face the earth and see my reflection in a congealed puddle of my melted skin. Disgust. I stand up, concrete rips the skin from my hands revealing muscle, I need to keep walking".</p>
    <p>He puts the pen down and starts silently sobbing. He has an interview at 8 with Comedy Central, they're going to make him answer questions while he balances on a slackline. To cope with the stress, he jerks off to a memory of Nadya giving him a dry handjob in the backseat of her Camry. They were listening to Alabama N***** and he came on her dashboard. It was the best orgasm of his life and now it's simply an idea. He doesn't bother cleaning the semen off his bedsheets, that's for the minimum wage Mexican custodian.</p>
    <p>While getting ready he desperately tries to recall what Nadya told him yesterday, but it's blank. On the drive home, he tries again but feels nothing. He feels her touch lingering on his skin but can't conjure her face. He thinks of Xiaxi, wondering why things had to turn out like this.</p>
    <p>He arrives at the Comedy Central offices, now a subsidiary of Blackrock. A very large black man approaches him, and Ethan instinctively reaches for the knife he keeps hidden within his ankle before realizing that he was the showrunner.</p>
    <p>"What an honour it is to have someone like you on our show," the large black man says in the tone of a large black man.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Avatar, I used to call myself EarthGod-Saw, you know" Ethan replies.</p>
    <p>"That's Nickelodeon."</p>
    <p>"I see, my apologies."</p>
    <p>Ethan leaves his dressing room and finds the four other PM candidates seated, naked, their cocks covered in infrared cream.</p>
    <p>"WELCOME TO THE COMEDY CENTRAL GAAAAAAAY CHICKEN CHALLENGE, TODAY WE'VE GOT ALL 4 OF THE LEADING MEMBERS FOR PM AND WE'RE GONNA PLAY THEM HARDCORE SISSY PORNNNNNN. CAN I GET AN OHHHHHHH YEAH FROM THE AUDIENCE"</p>
    <p>The audience is made up of a homeless guy named Tom and a transgender female named 'Ebony' who also has their cock out.</p>
    <p>Ethan weighs up the pros and cons of this situation. The cons are that the majority of the country's population will see his flaccid penis (impressive), but the pros are that they'll see his sick shredded 6-pack that he'll be constantly flexing (even more impressive). After about a minute of standing silently in front of the cameras, he rips off his suit, covers himself in baby powder, and sits on his allocated chair.</p>
    <p>"NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR LAST CONTESTANT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND 'EBONY', LEEEEET'S START THE GAME. OUR FIRST VIDEO IS 'BPD E GIRL LICKS PISS OFF SEWER SEAT AND GETS HARDCORE RIMMED'"</p>
    <p>Ethan sighs to himself in half relief and half disgust. It's a dom video, so he's safe for the first round. Nadya's trained him not to get hard to anything unless there's a foot with pantyhose halfway into his esophagus.</p>
    <p>However, Mike Mikington, the Labour Party candidate, starts clawing into his flesh while his cock slowly rises like the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima.</p>
    <p>"Stop, no GOD make it STOPPP AHhhHHHHh STEPHANIE, I LOVED YOU!" he mutters before blasting his semen right onto Ethan's face. Ethan, however, doesn't notice because he's in da ZONE. It drips down from his chin into his lap.</p>
    <p>"LOOKS LIKE MIKE 'LABOUR' MIKINGTON IS OOOOOOOUUUUUUUUT OF THE RUNNING, BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, MIKE, GUESS YOU COULDN'T KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS HAHA, MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE USED TO MORE LABOUR, TRIED A BIT HARDER, LOSER"</p>
    <p>For the second round, all contestants are forced to give their position on the European immigration crisis of '39 while being flagellated by an intersex person wearing a Santa Claus outfit. To a 19-year-old Ethan, this would've been a challenge, but throughout his passionate speech about how the country should keep blacks out, he only thinks of Nadya. She's given him the power to continue his racist tirade through the whipping, through the baby powder getting stuck in his asshole and making it itch ever so slightly, through the existential knowledge that his one true love might die any day now. He perseveres because he IS ETHAN MOTHERFUCKING SAW OHHHH YEAH.</p>
    <p>The ordeal is over, and for his hard work, Ethan is awarded one of those gold medals that have chocolate on the inside. He receives a call from the hospital; they ask him to come as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>He meets with a doctor outside of Nadya's room.</p>
    <p>"I think you should take these moments to say your peace. I'm sorry, by the way, wanna hang out tomorrow? We can go to Ruby Tuesdays, haha bitch ass," the doctor says.</p>
    <p>(By the way, the doctor is Winston Lam)</p>
    <p>Ethan enters the room; Nadya's lying down by the window. The light reflects around the room and illuminates the hollow crevices on her face. He loves her.</p>
    <p>They lie down beside each other, hand in hand. Nadya doesn't speak, maybe because she can't or maybe because she's said everything she needs to say.</p>
    <p>Through the weight of his tears, Ethan somehow speaks,</p>
    <p>"In some world, we would've been together forever. The correct people in the wrong life. Our souls are conjoined at the hip. Out of everyone, you loved me when no one else dared to try, embraced my flesh with your soul, and let me feel the warmth of another. I loved you beyond words, beyond concepts, and beyond myself. Through my eyes, I could only see you, your smile, your life expressed through the frigid mannerisms of the world. Now I know why love makes such good poetry; this feeling is indescribable, hundreds of lives unlived. I'm sorry; I'm not sure why these words spill out of my mouth, but I mean it all, more than any other syllable I've ever dared to utter before. We were supposed to walk side by side for all eternity; you agreed, but it's like you never cared. Or maybe you did, but it was just too much. Thank you for every single moment you've given me, for every single memory I will repeat until eternity. I'm not ready; I never will be, but I've felt love once Thank you for the rest of my life, Thank you."</p>
    <p>"Wungos!" Nadya says before the heart rate moniter flatlines</p>
