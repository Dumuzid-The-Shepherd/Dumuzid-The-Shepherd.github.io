    <p>20 years ago, I met her. I&rsquo;ve suffered since then. 100-hour workweeks, many sleepless nights, countless more deaths. She was there through it all, she loved me not because of intelligence, or wealth or joy but despite my stupidity, my greed and my misery. God must be omnibenevolent; I gave everything to her, and God took it. These walls continue to close in, and I will eventually be crushed. I can&rsquo;t do this anymore, not without her.</p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      <p>God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of "parties" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship - but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible and overpowering.</p>

    <p>For a while I had nothing but my friends, but then I had her and they fell to the wayside. They had their own lives, it was mutual, to an extent. It always happens, that's how life is, it's how life always will be. I miss them. I need to do something grand.</p>
    <p>My 3 loyal readers would know about that schizophrenic guy I used to hang out with, Ahan. The brown one, anyway, he always used to talk (schizophrenically) about a Vegas trip that we were supposed to have but was somehow disrupted due to some unforeseen circumstances. The guy literally wouldn&rsquo;t let it go, but I&rsquo;ve got nothing else going on in this life so I&rsquo;m going to make sure we complete this trip. I&rsquo;m taking my entire net worth and going on the lam. But first I need to find the remaining members of the study group. Starting with Kailan</p>
